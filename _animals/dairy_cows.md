Nothing sets the rhythm of the farm quite like milking a cow twice a day, every day. Each day Papa and one of the kids get up at 5:30 in the morning to milk Philomena and then milk her again in the evening. Each year, Philomena is artificially inseminated (AI'd) to have a calf. By having a calf each year, Philomena will have a fairly steady supply. We do let her rest for the two months before her calf is due to be born. Philomena's milk supply is the highest right after she calves or "freshens" and in the spring and summer when she has lush pastures to graze on. In the winter her production falls off because the quality of the forage does. Even in the winter we will get more than 2 gallons of milk a day, which is plenty for a family our size. The surplus milk goes into making cheese, yogurt, butter, and most importantly - ice cream. To supplement Philomena's diet, she receives about 5 lbs of feed at each milking that we get from the <a href="http://dextermill.com">Dexter Mill</a>. Papa and the kids use a really cool [Surge belly milker](http://surgemilker.com) so that they don't have to milk her by hand. Philomena is a registered Jersey, a breed known because their milk has very high butter fat and they have very feminine facial features. This is highly correlated with meat tenderness and flavor in their steers. She can be a bit sassy, making us think she's a "Jersey Girl", but alas she's not from New Jersey, but [old Jersey](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jersey/@49.2110419,-2.2727156,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x480c52a48c927533:0x519c23a30a1a6cc3)! Each summer the kids take Philomena and the other Jersey's we've had to the Chelsea fair where they compete against the big mean Holstein cows. In 2015, John took Scholastica, a heifer calf, to the Chelsea Fair and was named the Jersey Grand Champion and the overall Grand Reserve Champion when she was only three months old! Check out the video of John and Scholastica below. We do our best to sell Scholastica and our heifers to other family farms. The kids take great pride in halter training them so that they make for great family dairy cows. If you are interested in starting dairying or want to expand your herd, please let us know. The bull calves are castrated to become steers a few days after birth and live their life as a [beef cow](beef_cattle.html). Because of their relatively small size (compared to a mean Holstein or Angus) Jersey steers do well on a 100% grass diet and have very flavorful meat. Taking care of the dairy cows is one of the more demanding chores on the farm, but one of the most rewarding because milk is such a central part of our diet.
