Nothing says Thanksgiving like a turkey on the dinner table. Each summer, Sarah takes great pride in raising turkeys on our pasture. She gets days old Broad Breasted White chicks in July and rotates them around the farm where they eat bugs, grass, and enjoy the all natural feed we get from the <a href="http://dextermill.com">Dexter Mill</a>. These birds receive no antibiotics or artificial hormones. The turkeys range in weights between 14 and 28 pounds and will give you a Thanksgiving unlike any other. Every year, people tell us that their turkey was the best they've ever had. Keep us in mind for your next Thanksgiving dinner and be sure to order yours early since these go fast!
