		<h2>Animals</h2>
		<div class="blurb">
			Our farm has a diverse collection of animals that act mutualistically to maintain their health and productivity. We raise sheep, cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and ducks to produce high quality and energy packed products for members of our community. All of our animals are raised without the use of artificial hormones or growth-promoting antibiotics on the pastures of our 25 acre farm in Dexter, MI. Any feeds we give our animals come from local farmers and the <a href="https://www.dextermill.com">Dexter Mill</a>. We also often feed our animals food processing byproducts. Currently we supplement the diet of our animals with spent barley from <a href="https://www.wolverinebeer.com">Wolverine State Brewing Company</a>. Our goal is to raise our animals in as humane and transparent a manner as possible. We'd love to have you out for one of our open houses to learn more about our animals. For now, feel free to check out the links below to learn more about how we raise the animals and how you can enjoy the great meat, eggs, and wool products grown on our farm.
