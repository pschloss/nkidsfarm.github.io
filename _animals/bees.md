Central to what we do at Eight Kids Farm is the ability to care for our pastures to feed the sheep and cows. One component of that is to introduce pollinators that help the clover and alfalfa to grow and provide a source of protein to the ruminants. In 2015, we brought honey bees to the farm to help pollinate. It is pretty amazing to see the bees working the pastures. Although we think of ourselves as "big animal" farmers, our bees probably out number the number of other animals on our farm by at least 10,000 to 1! Lucky for us, the bees also produce honey. Honey is known for its antimicrobial properties and some think that it helps provide allergens in a form that alleviates allergies. Also, our bees do not receive any antibiotics. Eating local, raw, unadulturated honey is one of the most amazing things. When Papa dispenses the honey at the end of the year, it's all we can do to keep him from putting his mouth under the tap!
