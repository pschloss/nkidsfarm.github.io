We raise several batches of broilers or "meat birds" throughout the summer. Although we used to sell whole chickens to people, we found that we couldn't bring ourselves to charge what they were really worth. Regardless, we regularly receive rave reviews for the taste and juiciness of our chickens' meat.  The chickens we raise are called “Freedom Ranger”, which were originally developed in France under their “Label Rouge” guidelines for humane meat production.  These birds were originally bred to be raised on pasture, making for a breed that are great foragers. In addition to their foraging, they eat a GMO-free grain-based feed that we get from the <a href="http://dextermill.com">Dexter Mill</a>. Although they love sitting by their feeders all day, our meat birds have free range of the farm. At night they go into their chicken tractors (see the picture with Ruth) for protection and we move these around the farm. We've found that although the ground isn't pretty after we move the tractors, within weeks the grass grows in more lush and darker than it was before. These birds take 12 weeks to grow to a final weight of 6-7 lbs.
