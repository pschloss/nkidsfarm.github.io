Unfortunately, scientists have yet to develop an all-bacon pig.  Until then, we enjoy raising heritage breeds of pigs that have great personalities. Because they havenâ€™t had the fat bred out of them, they also taste great. We've had seasoned pig farmers taste our pork and tell us that it is the best pork they have ever tasted. We have two [Hereford sows](http://www.livestockconservancy.org/index.php/heritage/internal/hereford) (LeftEye and RightEye) and a [Berkshire boar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_pig) (Bart) that are some of the sweetest animals on our farm. If you rub a sow on her side, she'll lay down and beg you to rub her belly. If you rub Bart on his back, he starts rocking back and forth in delight. This big pigs are a bit scary at first, but they're very easy to warm up to. We have also raised a number of batches of pigs where we buy weaned piglets (feeder pigs) from area farmers. These are also very friendly animals! In the summer of 2015, Patrick raised two feeder pigs to show and auction at the Washtenaw County 4H Fair. He did a great job for his first time and is anxious to show our Hereford pigs in 2016. Here's a video of what showing pigs looks like. It's really more like the pigs showing the kids!

We raise our pigs year around outside on grass where they love plowing up the pasture. Like chickens, pigs are omnivores that need a diet with a higher protein content than the sheep and cows. Their diet consists of whey from the [White Lotus goat dairy](http://www.whitelotusfarms.com), kitchen scraps, and grain. We buy a GMO-free grain from the <a href="http://dextermill.com">Dexter Mill</a>. Needless to say, these pigs receive no antibiotics or artificial hormones in their diet.

After six months, our pigs weigh 300 to 350 lbs and produce a carcass that weighs 200 to 220 lbs. The typical live market weight is 270 lbs, but we find that by adding teh extra weight there is more fat and flavor in the meat. For pork sales, we take reservations with a deposit for quarter, half, or whole animals that will be processed at <a href="http://dunbarmeats.com">Dunbar's Meat Packing Company</a>. You'll be able to tell them exactly how you want your portion processed. Please see our diary posts on what to expect from a whole pig and what do once we take your animal to Dunbar's for more information on the process of communicating with Dunbar's and paying.
