If you ever get to visit our farm, one of the first things youâ€™ll notice is the flock of hens that roams freely across the farm. Our flock is a mix of breeds that lay mainly brown eggs; we have a few ladies that lay green and white eggs too. The hens love to hunt for insects and seeds and eat our kitchen scraps, but they also receive an organic, GMO-free grain-based feed, which we get from the <a href="http://dextermill.com">Dexter Mill</a> that satisfies their omnivorous cravings. They also enjoy butter milk and whey from our cows and that from a local goat dairy. Although peak production is during the summer, they do lay eggs year around. Because they are only productive for a couple years, in the fall we frequently have butchered "spent" hens that are great for making broth and soups. To get some great tasting eggs, just call to schedule a pick up.
