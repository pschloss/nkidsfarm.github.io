If you look out at our pastures you’ll see some pretty funny looking sheep – those are cows!  We currently have a mixture of [dairy breeds](dairy_cows.html) and beef breeds. Because you can't milk a dairy steer, those become beef cattle. We currently have Jersey and Guernsey steers. The Jersey steers come from our milk cows and the Guernsey steers are former Chelsea Fair projects that Joe raised as part of the Dairy Feeder Club. In 2014 he placed 1st in showmanship for his age division and in 2015 he placed 2nd! Check out the video below from the fair. John thinks that in 2016 he'd like to follow in his big brother's footsteps and raise a dairy feeder calf for the fair too. Needless to say Joe loves his cows. Over the years Joe has pooled his money from raising and selling steers to buy his own herd of [registered purebred Belted Galloway cows](http://beltie.org). These are the iconic black and white "oreo cows". They're an amazing breed for growing on a 100% grass diet. They have a two layered coat that makes them especially well suited for [southwest Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galloway) and Michigan winters. The picture to the top right shows Joe (with Mary's help) showing Hazel and her calf Thomas at the 2015 Washtenaw County 4H Fair. Joe showed Hazel and got 4th place in showmanship and 3rd for showing the cow-calf pair. In 2016, Thomas will make a repeat appearance at the fair where Joe will show him in the beef class and will sell him in the auction.

During the grazing season you'll find the cattle grazing the farm with the sheep. Papa implements [management intensive grazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_intensive_rotational_grazing) where he moves the animals to a new section of grass every 12 hrs. This insures that they graze the grass evenly, prevents them from being overly picky, allows the grass time to rest and regrow, and minimizes the animals' exposure to intestinal parasites. The cattle receive no artificial hormones or antibiotics, and have a grain-free diet. They aren't certified organic, but you might say that these animals are "beyond" organic. Sorry, but we don't currently have any heifers for sale as breeding stock.

For beef sales, we take reservations with a deposit for quarter, half, or whole animals that will be processed at <a href="http://dunbarmeats.com">Dunbar's Meat Packing Company</a>. You'll be able to tell them exactly how you want your portion processed. Please see our diary posts on what to expect from a whole beef animal and what do once we take your animal to Dunbar's for more information on the process of communicating with Dunbar's and paying.
