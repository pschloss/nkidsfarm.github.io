		<h2>Wool Products</h2>
		<div class="blurb">
			Once a year the sheep are sheared to remove their thick wool sweaters that they don't need for the Michigan summers. After the shearers have left, we take the raw wool to <a href="http://www.zwool.com">Zeilinger's Wool Mill</a> in Frankenmuth. We work with their wonderful staff to have the wool processed so that we can produce excellent woolen products from our flock. You can find our products at the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/NKidsFarm?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=793786522" target="_blank">nkidsfarm Etsy site</a>. We are also happy to produce custom products if you would like to commission one of our expert artisans.
