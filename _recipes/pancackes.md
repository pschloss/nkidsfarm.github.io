title:  "Papa's Sunday Morning Pancakes"
type: "dairy"
picture: ../assets/img/pancakes.jpg
ingredients:
  Flour: 4 cups
  Salt: 1 tsp
  Baking soda: 1 tsp
  Baking powder: 2 tsp
  Sugar: 1/4 cup
  Eggs: 2
  Butter: 6 Tbsp
  Buttermilk: 1 qt
  Maple syrup: a lot
instructions:
  - Assemble the dry ingredients in one bowl and wisk together
  - Beat the eggs in a separate bowl that's can hold at least two quarts
  - Pour melted butter in with the eggs and mix
  - Pour buttermilk in with the egg and butter mixture and mix
  - Pour the liquid mixture in with the dry mixture and gently, but thoroughly mix together
  - Use a ladle, pour pancake batter onto a buttered hot griddle.
  - When the batter starts to bubble and the bubbles remain open, flip the pancake. If the cooked surface is yellowish, you need to increase the temperature. If it's black, reduce the heat. Once the bottom edge of the pancake seems to pull off of the griddle, they're good to go.
  - Reserve the pancakes in the oven at 200F to keep them warm
  - Serve with warmed <a href="http://whitneyfarm.squarespace.com/maple-syrup/">maple syrup</a>

blurb: Nearly every Sunday morning before we go to Mass papa will make us pancakes. These come out light and fluffy. Just make sure that papa can take a nap before Mass so he doesn't nod off during Mass!
notes:
 - If papa is going to add bananas, chocolate chips, etc. he typically does this once the batter is on the griddle
 - Milk is a fine substitute for buttermilk. The Test Kitchen cookbook suggests adding some lemon juice to the milk to give it some tang, but papa is typically too lazy for such things
 - Don't over beat the batter or it will taste like drywall spackle
 - Your family needs a pancake cutter
