title:  "Farm fresh butter & buttermilk"
type: "dairy"
picture: ../assets/img/butter.jpg
ingredients :
  1 qt : Cream
instructions:
  - If you put cow milk into the refrigerator over night the cream will rise to the top and the milk will sit on the bottom. This is often called "cream line milk". Using a metal 1/4 cup measuring cup, we bend the handle upwards at a 90 degree angle to make a ladle. We then skim the milk by pulling off the cream and transferring it into a quart jar. Once you've skimmed 3 or 4 half-gallon jars of whole milk, you'll have a quart of cream.
  - Dump the cream into a KitchenAid mixer bowl and mix the cream concoction with the wisk attachment and set the mixer to a medium or medium high setting. You'll probably want to drape the mixer with a towel to prevent the buttermilk from splashing once the butter comes out of the milk.
  - As you mix the milk it will initially look like whipped cream (duh). A little later, this will look like it has fallen apart and will look like a white soup with little globules in it. After this stage, those globules will start to come together and form small chunks of butter. You'll notice a change in the sound and you'll find that the buttermilk is starting to splash around a bit. Turn off the mixer.
  - Turn on your sink and get the cold water going and get an empty quart jar ready. Using your hand to make a cup around the butter globules hold it against the side of the mixing bowl and pour the buttermilk into the empty jar. Cap that and put your buttermilk into the fridge. Now put some water into the bowl with the butter and mold the butter into a ball washing the butter globules to get rid of the white film that has formed.
  - Take the ball out of the bowl and hold it under the tap and work the butter opening it and closing it to get the buttermilk out.
  - Now take the ball and either use it fresh or wrap it in plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator or freezer.

blurb: Why would you ever want to make your own butter? Well, do you see the two types of butter on the bread? The yellow butter is fresh from our cows and the white is "fresh" from Meijer. This butter has a distinct flavor and smell that warms the soul.
notes:
  - A variation on this is to let the cream sit out overnight to "ripen". Alternatively, you can buy special cultures to make cultured butter. This will give the butter a tangy flavor.
  - Of course, you can make your own butter from store bought cream.
  - A fun task for little ones is to put cream into a ziplock back or a jelly jar and have them shake the cream until butter emerges. Nearly guaranteed to get them to leave you alone in the kitchen.
