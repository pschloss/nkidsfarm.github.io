picture: ../assets/img/shepherds_pie.jpg
ingredients :
    Olive oil: 1 Tbsp
    Butter: 1 Tbsp
    Diced onion: 1
    Lean ground lamb: 2 lbs.
    All-purpose flour: 1/3 cup
    Pepper and salt: to taste
    Fresh minced rosemary: 2 tsp
    Paprika: 1 tsp
    Ground cinnamon: 1/8 tsp
    Ketchup: 1 Tbsp
    Minced garlic: 3 cloves
    Water: 2 1/2 cups or as needed
    Frozen peas and carrots: 1 12 oz. pkg.
    Peeled and halved Yukon Gold potatoes: 2 1/2 lbs.
    Ground cayenne pepper: 1 pinch
    Cream cheese: 1/4 cup
    Shredded Irish cheese: 1/4 lb.
    Egg yolk: 1
    Milk: 2 Tbsp
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
  - Place olive oil and butter in Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in onion and ground lamb; brown the meat, breaking it up into small crumbles as it cooks, about 10 minutes.
  - Stir in flour until incorporated, then mix in salt, black pepper, rosemary, paprika, cinnamon, ketchup, and garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
  - Stir in water and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the Dutch oven. Reduce heat to medium-low and bring mixture to a simmer; cook and stir until thick, about 5-6 minutes.
  - Remove lamb mixture from heat and stir in peas and carrots until combined.
  - Spread lamb mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish and set aside.
  - Place potatoes into a large pan of salted water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well and return potatoes to pan.
  - Mash butter, cayenne pepper, cream cheese, and Irish cheese into the potatoes. Mash until combined and potatoes are smooth. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
  - Whisk together egg yolk and milk in a small bowl; stir into the mashed potato mixture.
  - Top the lamb mixture in the baking dish with the mashed potatoes and spread evenly to cover.
  - Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and sauce is bubbling up around the edges, 25 to 30 minutes.
