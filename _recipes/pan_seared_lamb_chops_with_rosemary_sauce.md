title:  "Lamb Chops With Rosemary Sauce"
type: "lamb"
picture: ../assets/img/pan_seared_lamb_chops.jpg
ingredients :
  Lamb loin or rib chops 3/4 to 1 inch thick, trimmed: 8
  Salt and pepper: as needed
  Vegetable oil: 2 Tbsp
  Minced shallots: 2
  Dry red wine: 1 cup
  Chicken broth: 3/4 cup
  Unsalted butter cut into 3 pieces: 3 Tbsp
  Minced fresh rosemary: 2 1/2 tsp
instructions:
  - For the chops- Packed the chops dry with paper towels, and season with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown the chops on the first side, about four minutes.
  - Flip the chops over and continue to cook to the desired doneness, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer the chops to a clean plate, tent with foil, and let rest for five minutes.
  - For the sauce- Meanwhile, add the oil to the skillet and return to medium heat until shimmering. Add the shallots and cook until softened, about two minutes. Stir in the wine and broth, scraping up any browned bits, and simmer until thickened, about five minutes.
  - Stir in any accumulated meat juice. Turn the heat to low bandwidth in the butter, one piece at a time. Off the heat, stir in the rosemary and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the sauce over the chops before serving.
