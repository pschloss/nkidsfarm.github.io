ingredients :
    All-purpose flour: 2 cups
    Sugar: 2 tsp
    Baking powder: 2 tsp
    Salt: 1/2 tsp

instructions:
  - Adjust an oven rack to the upper-middle position and heat the oven to 450Â°. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in the cream with a wooden spoon until the dough forms, about 30 seconds. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and gather into a ball. Kneed the dough briefly until smooth, about 30 seconds.
  - Pat the dough into a 3/4-inch-thick circle. Cut the dough into rounds using a 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter or eight wedges using a knife. Place the biscuits on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes
