		<h2>Breeding Stock</h2>
		<p>We raise purebred Polypay sheep that are registered by the <a href="http://polypay.org">American Polypay Association</a> and the <a href="http://nsip.org/polypay-breeders/">National Sheep Improvement Program</a>. This breed is known for their strong maternal characteristics including prolificacy, milk production, early fertility, and mothering ability. Beyond these traits, we are attempting to select for stock that do well in system where ewes lamb 3 times in two years (i.e. every 8 months). Get in touch with us if you are interested in purchasing any breeding stock.</p>
